# Problem 1

The dataset is available in input folder.

I first started by loading necessary libraries and then loaded the datsets.
After that  information about data is shown so as to get a little insights about the datasets.
I have tried to show the relation between each factors using correlational plot.
I have tried to give a comparative data and its visualisation of the facors which affects
the survival of a person on the titanic.
