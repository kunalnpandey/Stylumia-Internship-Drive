# Problem 2

The dataset is available in input folder.

I have designed the algorithm to predict number of times a student consumes alcohol
in a week by giving input its certain data.

I have made a comparative analysis of different multiclass classifier machine learning model
and tried to visualise each of them based on accuracy of their prediction,error,etc.

I have used KNN,SVM,Random Forest Classifeir, Decision Tree,Naive Bayes Classifier,etc to predict
the results so as to get insights on how the accuracy differs.

I started fisrt with loading necessary libraries and then loaded the two datasets.
Then I merged the two datasets into a single datasets.
After that I analysed the behaviour of data by visualising it with different prospective.

Plotted heatmap so as to get insights on which variable to choose and which to ignore.
Then I dropped the unnecessary varaibles and divided the datasets into train and test sets respectively.

After that I used those datasets to train the classifier 
After training test sets input were fed and predicted output with respective classifier was recoded

Confusion matrix was printed along with accuracy of algorithm ,mean error, standard deviation,etc.

At the end I have tried to visualise the accuracy predicted by the respective classifier.
